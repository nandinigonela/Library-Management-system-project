# Library-Management-system-project
we will build Library Management System using MYSQL. We will build the database, which includes tables. Imagine that you go to the library, take a book, and just enter that book into the computer rather than entering your details and book details in a register. Isn’t it easy and convenient? Here comes the library management system. This system is handy for people going to the library and searching for their desired book and for the librarian to guide them and take care of these things. It ensures that everything works in systematic order, given that each person taking or returning books needs to enter the record in the system.
Record while issuing books- When anyone takes a book, staff should be able to scan the barcode on the book and should be able to enter the record.
Profile editing- Staff should be able to edit the profile and the profiles of the people with membership in that library.
They should be able to keep track of books issued by them.
Should be able to ask, request, or demand the books from the people who took that if they crossed the due date.
They should be able to track books, their place, and so on.
If there occurs any change in the system, or if anyone else entered details or tried to access the system, staff should get the notification.
They should be able to create their account themselves
If their desired book is not available in the library, they should be able to request that particular book.
They should be able to receive notification if the due date for any particular book is exceeded.
By giving details of a particular book like the name of the book, author, and published by, they should be able to find the book’s place in the library.
A payment option should be there so that students can pay their membership fees, late fees, and so on.
In the following code, we will be using MYSQL and the names of some books so that they would be easy to understand.
